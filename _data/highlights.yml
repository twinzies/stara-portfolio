  title: 'Sycophancy or Empathy ? “Deep Reflect”: A system design to analyze and generate responses to personal queries'
  organization: "Masters in AI [in-progress]"
  date: "September 2025"
  description: "This research project analyzes and compares AI-generated responses with human answers to personal queries. It focuses on two major themes in NLP: LLM responses are often perceived as more empathic yet also more sycophantic than those of humans. The project introduces Deep Reflect, a flexible framework built for this study, adaptable to broader use cases, and supporting a new chain-of-thought approach for mitigating such tendencies in LLM outputs."
