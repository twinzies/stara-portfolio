  title: 'Sycophancy or Empathy ? “Deep Reflect”: A system design to analyze and generate responses to personal queries'
  organization: "Masters in AI [in-progress]"
  date: "September 2025"
  description: "This study analyzes and compared AI generated responses to human personal queries. The study investigates two major themes in NLP research - where LLM responses are perceived to be more empathic and also, under some paradigms more sycophantic in their responses to personal questions. Deep Reflect is an extensible framework designed for the project and investigations."
